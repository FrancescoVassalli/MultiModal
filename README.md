# MultiModal

If you have conda you might want to deactivate. I amsuming no conda. I am also assuming you have python3.11 installed on the command line. 

## Installation

1. Setup local `.env` file and adjust variables with appropriate values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies and build a local version of the package.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
